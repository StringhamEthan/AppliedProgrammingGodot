# Overview


This game is a coop PvE Top-Down fighting game where the players take on increasingly difficult waves of enemies, using a variety of weapons such as spears, bows, and swords to fight their way to victory.

The controls are as follows:
W,A,S, and D: move around
Your character will automatically look at your mouse.
1,2,3, and 4 will change your item
Left click will use a weapons basic attack, or punch if you have none equipped
Right click will use a weapons alternative attack

The easiest way to start a game is to hit the host button and then the start game button

I wanted to become more knowledgeable on the up and coming engine Godot, specifically in using animation to drive gameplay. This project heavily uses animationtrees to drive gameplay, such as a charging animation calling a function to move the player forward. It also features multiplayer as another complex feature I wanted to learn more about.
